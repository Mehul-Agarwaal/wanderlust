## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (which includes npm)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone [https://github.com/Mehul-Agarwaal/wanderlust.git](https://github.com/Mehul-Agarwaal/wanderlust.git)
    cd wanderlust
    ```

2.  **Install NPM packages:**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project and add the following variables. You will need to get your own API keys from the respective services.

    ```env
    # Cloudinary Credentials for image storage
    CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=<your_cloud_name>
    CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
    CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=<your_api_secret>

    # Mapbox API Token for maps
    MAP_TOKEN=<your_mapbox_token>

    # MongoDB Connection URL
    # For local DB: MONGO_URL=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/wanderlust
    # For Atlas: MONGO_URL=<your_mongodb_atlas_connection_string>
    MONGO_URL=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/wanderlust

    # A secret string for signing the session ID cookie
    SECRET=<your_session_secret>
    ```

4.  **Run the application:**
    The project uses `nodemon` for development, which automatically restarts the server on file changes.
    ```sh
    nodemon app.js
    ```
    If you don't have `nodemon` installed globally, you can use `node`:
    ```sh
    node app.js
    ```
    The application should now be running on `http://localhost:8080`.
